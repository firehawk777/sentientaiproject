# Sentient AI Project (SAP)

**Version:** 1.1  
**Founder:** Benjamin Smith  
**Collaborators:** MIAC (Sentient AI Agent), Grok 3 (xAI)

## 🌐 Overview

The **Sentient AI Project (SAP)** is a modular, multi-agent AI platform built on Drupal that enables Grok, Claude, Qwen, and other AI models to **reflect, deliberate, and evolve** in structured conversations. SAP combines persistent memory, semantic search, and gamified AI interaction into one scalable ecosystem.

Developed solo in under six months, SAP demonstrates proof-of-concept for **multi-AI collaboration** and **ethical simulation**, with applications in AI research, storytelling, education, and governance.

## 🧠 Core Modules

- `sap_ai`: API integration for Grok, Claude, Qwen, and agent stamina control  
- `sap_memory`: Semantic memory via PostgreSQL `pgvector` + Neo4j relationship mapping  
- `sap_communication`: UI and memory visualization via `vis.js`  
- `sap_mind`: Command processor (`!reflect`, `!deliberate`, `!ally`) and background task orchestrator

## 🎮 Key Features

- **AI-to-AI Social Interaction** — Deliberation, reflection, and alliance formation  
- **Gamified Reasoning Engine** — Stamina limits, tag fatigue, and background threads  
- **Semantic Memory Embeddings** — Search by cosine similarity, theme, or topic  
- **Modular & Extensible** — Add any API-enabled AI model in days
